# Rust-AB: An Agent-Based Simulation engine in Rust

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spagnuolocarmine/abm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spagnuolocarmine/abm)

Rust-AN is a discrete events simulation engine for developing ABM simulation that is written in a novel programming language named Rust. Rust-AB is designed to be a _ready-to-use_ tool for the ABM community and for this reason the architectural concepts of the well-adopted MASON library were re-engineered.


## Examples: Boids Simulation

The Boids model by C. Raynolds, 1986, is a steering behavior ABM for autonomous agents, which simulates the flocking behavior of birds. The agent behavior is derived by a linear combination of three independent rules: _Separation_: steer in order to avoid crowding local flockmates; _Alignment_: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates; _Cohesion_: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates.
